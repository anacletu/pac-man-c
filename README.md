## Features

- Text-based game with simple controls.
- Randomized ghost movement for a challenge.
- Win the game by collecting the treasure.
- Lose the game if a ghost catches you.
- Possibility to personalize the map without changing code.

## Project Highlights

- **Custom Data Structures**: The game leverages custom data structures, such as structs, to manage game elements like the map and actors.
- **File Handling**: The project employs file handling to read and load the game map from an external file.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory is dynamically allocated for the map, providing efficient management.
- **In-Game Logic**: The game implements logic for actor movement, collision detection, and simple AI behavior.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling is included, making use of standard error codes and messages for debugging.
- **ASCII Art**: ASCII Art handled in arrays in order to make the game more visually appealing.

## Getting Started

### How to Play

1. Use the WASD keys and press ENTER to move the C-Man around the map.
